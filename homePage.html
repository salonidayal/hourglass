        <p class="section-lead">Physical health is very important but so is mental health. We want to tell you that you are not alone in this.</p>

            <h4>In-person therapy</h4>
            <p>Few of us are completely equipped with the tools needed for mental health in daily living; we often need an objective sounding board to bounce life experiences off of in order to see patterns and emotions that need further evaluation. The need for in person therapy in 2021 is higher now than ever before. In general, we humans feel a need to decompress from the pressures and stresses of life as we learn new techniques for self-care and regulation that can improve our quality of life.</p>

            <h4>Community</h4>
            <p>Treating mental illness in 2021 may look different from years past, but that is no excuse to isolate yourself and wallow in your own unique set of issues. Building a solid community of support, love, and friendships around you will be an essential part of your wellness journey. Surround yourself with like-minded people; those who wish to become healthier and happier, and be uplifted by conversations, in-person meetings, virtual care services and exchanges with your circle of support. In doing so, you'll realize that this journey is not a solo trip, and that you have people around you to improve the quality of your life.</p>

            <h4>Physical health</h4>
            <p>The body and the brain are intimately interconnected, and the health of one affects the health of the other. Your body is an intricate network of systems all working together to help you navigate life successfully, and you have a responsibility to take care of it. Eating well, getting adequate exercise, sleep, and hydration are valuable actions you can take to preserve your physical well-being, which in turn will help you feel more positive about life in general.</p>

            <h4>Intellectual health</h4>
            <p>Exercising your mind and committing to being a lifelong learner is a valuable part of your mental health process as well. With all aspects of health, intellectual health requires balance; learning new skills and acquiring new knowledge will open up doors of opportunity that can improve your life significantly.</p>

            <h4>Environmental health</h4>
            <p>Your environment can significantly impact your mental state of mind; those who are subjected to daily stressors and living conditions that are less than ideal can negatively impact your environmental health and cause mental illness. Doing what you can to remove those aspects of your life that are stressing you out----relationships, living conditions, social situations, physical health issues----will help to reduce the stress response in your brain that can contribute to poor cognitive function</p>

            <h4>Boundaries</h4>
            <p>It is impossible to fulfill all of life's obligations and take care of yourself as well; setting boundaries and learning to say "no" to those things that are not essential will allow you to carve out some time for safeguarding your mental health. You may initially feel guilty if you haven't said no to friends and family before, but the more you stand up for yourself and take back your time, the easier it will be to practice the daily habits that preserve your mental wellness.</p>

        <p class="section-lead">The gifts of the last few years include more time for many---people are learning the fine art of self-care as we sit inside our homes, for we have no choice but to take an introspective look at what we need most. Doing those things that nurture body, soul, and spirit will improve not only your life, but the lives of those around you.</p>
